This project is a code-along of the Mario game developed by [Ania Kubow](https://youtu.be/2nucjefSr6I). It served as a template for creating my own version of the Mario game while following Ania's tutorial.

## Project Overview

The Mario Game Code Along is a game development project using JavaScript and HTML5 canvas. By following Ania's tutorial, I learned the fundamentals of game development and built my own version of the iconic Mario game.
